# Women’s Health Investment Analysis
---

## Final Report
**[🔗 View the full PDF report here](ProblemStatement_MadelineCoert.pdf)**  
*A concise summary of findings, visuals and recommendations.*

This project analyses global data on fertility, maternal mortality, female labour participation and health expenditure to evaluate how women’s healthcare investment impacts both social outcomes and economic growth, using R for data cleaning, visualisation and statistical analysis.  

The goal was to conduct exploratory data analysis to identify relationships between health spending, reproductive outcomes and workforce participation, and generate actionable insights to inform policy and investment strategies.

## Project Overview

- **Client:** Academic Research Project  
- **Role:** Data Analyst / Researcher  
- **Tools Used:** R, tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, zoo, rnaturalearth  
- **Dataset:** Global datasets from World Bank, UN, and IHME (1990–2020)  
- **Deliverable:** Full analytical report + data visualisations + recommendations

## Key Insights
- **Fertility and mortality are linked:** Countries with higher fertility rates consistently show higher maternal mortality, though targeted investment reduces this risk.  
- **Health spending drives survival:** Greater healthcare expenditure is strongly associated with lower maternal mortality, especially in low- and middle-income nations.  
- **Economic gains from inclusion:** Improved reproductive health correlates with higher female labour force participation, unlocking significant productivity potential.  
- **Cross-country divergence:** Developed nations like Australia show low fertility and stable female participation, while developing nations such as Nigeria face barriers due to limited healthcare access.  

## Recommendations
- **Prioritise reproductive healthcare investment:** Expand funding to reduce maternal deaths and support women’s workforce entry.  
- **Integrate education initiatives:** Strengthen reproductive health education alongside medical investment to improve preventative outcomes.  
- **Address gender gaps in research:** Increase funding for women’s health research to reduce diagnostic delays and long-term costs.  
- **Align with SDGs:** Frame women’s health investment as a moral and economic strategy supporting SDG 3, 5 and 8.

## Techniques Applied

- Data cleaning, outlier treatment and interpolation of missing values  
- Exploratory analysis with scatterplots, line graphs and grouped bar charts  
- Comparative analysis across countries and health expenditure groups  
- Integration of multiple datasets into a unified master dataset  
- Visualisations created using `ggplot2` to highlight health–economy links  
- Interpretation of findings into evidence-based recommendations

## Reflections

This project helped me strengthen my ability to work with multi-source global datasets, clean and transform data, and communicate complex relationships through visual storytelling. It also reinforced the connection between data analytics and real-world impact, demonstrating how evidence can inform health policy and economic decision-making. With further development, this project could be extended into predictive modelling of maternal mortality trends or simulation of health investment scenarios.
